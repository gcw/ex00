Quick coding ex

These are not the droids you are looking for

to run the AWK code: 
   `awk -f ./ex.awk ./test.txt`

to run the KSH93 code:
   `ksh ./ex.ksh < test.txt`
or alternately
   `ksh93 ./ex.ksh < test.txt`
Depending on what your system calls KSH93. 
Note: this will not work on PDKSH and probably won't work on BASH or ZSH
